LCDjava demo projects
=====================

This repository contains sample projects that demonstrate how to use the basic
features of [LCDjava][], a Java client library for LCDproc.

The VCS history of this repository might seem a bit funny if you look at it. The
reason is that it was initially two repositories that were merged into a single
one.
